## Hi, I'm Dave.

I'm a Software Developer experienced in web-based application development. I've had exposure to a wide variety of different programming and scripting languages, but my main stack has been Vue, Nodejs and MondoDB. My primary interests are backend development and architecture, as I'm highly engaged by finding elegant solutions to large complex problems. I also place a high emphasis on quality over quantity, desiring to produce clean and efficient code incorporating best practises and established design principles.

This page will serve as somewhat of an index for the contents of my github. The repositories range across side-projects (most of which are unfinished :)), contributions, code samples, and so on. As a lot of my development work has been on in-house solutions in my public sector role, not too much of it is externally visible.
