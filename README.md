## Hi, I'm Dave.

I'm a Software Developer experienced in full stack application development. I've had exposure to a wide variety of different programming and scripting languages, but my main stack has been Nodejs/Typescript, Express, MongoDB and Vuejs. My primary interests are backend development and systems design, as I'm highly engaged by finding elegant solutions to complex and technically challenging problems. I also place a high emphasis on quality over quantity, desiring to produce clean and efficient code incorporating best practises and established design principles.

If you would like to get in touch, you can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davepmartinz/).

This page will serve as somewhat of an index for the contents of my github. The repositories range across side-projects (most of which are unfinished :)), contributions, code samples, and so on. As a lot of my development work has been on in-house solutions in my public sector role, not too much of which is externally accessible, but I've provided sanitised samples where possible.
